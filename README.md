# futmind-parser

A Python script that creates and initializes a static database for [FUT Pack Tracker](https://github.com/jacksonbarr1/fut-pack-tracker), a project that lets users track the type and amount of packs they have stored in EA Sports FC 24. The script uses tabular data from [Futmind](https://futmind.com/eafc-24-packs-ultimate-team) and parses it before insertion into a MySQL database.
